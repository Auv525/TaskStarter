## Points:
1. This tool is created by Qt Designer + PySide2 + python.
1. This tool is reading data from Shotgun or other production platforms.
2. I have used QCompleter in all QComboBox, so it can supports serching and automatic completion, which has good user experience.
3. I have used multiple yaml files to configure which tabs and which icons are shown in the widget. It makes modify and extension much esaier.

## Note:
This is my own example project, and the codes are not real, so it won't working in your machine.
